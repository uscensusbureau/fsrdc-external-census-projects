At Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs), researchers use restricted-access microdata to address important research questions. Excel workbooks containing metadata about active and completed projects, including project title, abstract, FSRDC location, principal investigator, year project started, researchers, and datasets requested in project proposals are available for download. Other Excel workbooks containing bibliographic information about written research outputs by FSRDC project are also available for download 

Currently metadata is only provided for projects that solely use Census Bureau datasets. Project information will be updated quarterly. 

The latest versions of the project metadata and research outputs workbooks can also be downloaded from https://www.census.gov/about/adrm/fsrdc/about/ongoing-projects.html.
